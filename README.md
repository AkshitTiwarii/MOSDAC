**Unlock the Future of Satellite Data with AI-Powered Insight**

We present MOSDAC Geospatial Help-Bot, a smart AI assistant designed to simplify access to meteorological and satellite data on the MOSDAC portal. The bot supports natural language queries, processes both static and dynamic content, and answers user questions with source-linked context and geospatial coverage maps. It combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline (using FAISS + BM25), a knowledge graph, and LLMs like GPT or DeepSeek to deliver accurate, explainable responses. Features include entity recognition, region-aware search, product lookup, and a clean Streamlit interface with performance metrics. The bot is fully modular, resource-efficient, and adaptable for other ISRO web platforms.
